        your-venv-dir/bin directory.


Application Installation
========================

1. Create a virtual env in your work directory. Here we use python3 venv module.  Use venv, like conda, if you please
    .. code-block:: bash

        cd your-work-dir
        python3 -m venv snovault-venv
        source snovault-venv/bin/activate

2. Clone the repo and install requirements
    .. code-block:: bash

        cd snovault
        pip install -e '.[dev]'

3. Build Application
    .. code-block:: bash

        # Make sure you are in the snovault-venv
        make clean && buildout

4. Run Application
    .. code-block:: bash

        # Make sure you are in the snovault-venv
        dev-servers development.ini --app-name app --clear --init --load
        # In a separate terminal, make sure you are in the snovault-venv
        pserve development.ini

5. Browse to the interface at http://localhost:6543

6. Run Tests
    * no argument runs non bdd tests

    .. code-block:: bash

        # Make sure you are in the snovault-venv
